# To-Do List App

A simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add tasks, set deadlines for them, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. It also stores your tasks in localStorage to persist the data even after the page is reloaded.

## Features
- Add tasks with a description and a deadline.
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them.
- Delete tasks by clicking on the delete button.
- The task list is stored in your browser's localStorage, so it persists across page reloads.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the source files.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
3. Add your tasks by typing in the input box and clicking the "Add" button.
4. Set a deadline for each task by selecting a date.
5. To mark a task as completed, click on the task name.
6. To delete a task, click on the delete icon (x).
